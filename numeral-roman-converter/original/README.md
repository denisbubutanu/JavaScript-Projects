## As explained earlier, this is my first take on the Number to Roman Numeral Converter. 

Inelegant, long and sloppy, but a working version nonetheless. I still kept it for the sake of comparasion. 

## How to run?

Using GitHub Pages, the following link should allow you to see the code in action: https://denisbubutanu.github.io/JavaScript-Projects/numeral-roman-converter/original/index.html

Note, this implementation should look exactly like the improved version. It should also give the same answer as the improved version.
