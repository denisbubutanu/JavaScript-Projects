## As explained earlier, this is my first take on the Number to Roman Numeral Converter. 

Inelegant, long and sloppy, but a working version nonetheless. I still kept it for the sake of comparasion. 


## Skills applied and design choices

During this project, I used string and array manipulation, DOM Manipulation and a lot of if-else statements, each with a lot of comparasion operators. The hardest part of the project was coming up with a good way to actually implement the converter. Although it worked (the specifics of the method are better explained by the comments on the script.js file itself), I was not satisfied with the outcome; I thought I could come up with a better method. Hence the existance of the "improved" version. 


## How to run?

Using GitHub Pages, the following link should allow you to see the code in action: https://denisbubutanu.github.io/JavaScript-Projects/numeral-roman-converter/original/index.html

Note, this implementation should look exactly like the improved version. It should also give the same answer as the improved version.
