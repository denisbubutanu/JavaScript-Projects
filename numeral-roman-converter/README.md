## This project is my latest and most difficult one I’ve done so far in JavaScript.

This is a Number to Roman Numeral Converter. It currently only allows numbers up to and including 3999.

## Why did I decide to do this?

I decided to do this because I initially had no idea how to approach it, and so I thought it would be a nice challenge. I was unsure of the best logic to use to make it work, so I spent quite some time thinking about it. After some experimentation, I came up with a solution that worked, althought it was rather sloppy and inelegant. The code ended up being rather cumbersome and hard to read, and I could not shake the feeling that there was a different, more elegant approach. As a result, I decided to create a better, more elegant version of it, but I still kept the old one for the sake of comparasion. The "original" folder is my first take on the project, while the "improved" folder hosts the better version.

## Skills applied and design choices

Each README.md file goes into slighlty more depth, but while the "original" version relied on if-else statements and number comparasions, the "improved" version used a recursive approach for cleaner and more elegant logic.

## How to run?

Each README.md file for both the "improved" and "original" versions will have a GitHub Pages link.
