## This project is my latest and most difficult one I’ve done so far in JavaScript.

While the coding part itself wasn’t particularly challenging, it took me some time to figure out exactly how I wanted to convert numerals to Roman numerals. Although I’m happy that it works, I realized the execution was rather sloppy. The code is hard to read, and there was definitely a better approach than using so many if-else statements. As a result, I decided to create a better and more elegant version of it, but I still kept the old one for comparison.
