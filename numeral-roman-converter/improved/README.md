## As mentioned before, this is the better take on the Numeral to Roman converter. 

Here I used an iterative approach on the converter while giving it a "legend" of sorts initially. I much prefer this approach to the original one; it taught me how to better use recursion and is much more readable and elegant compared to the original one.
