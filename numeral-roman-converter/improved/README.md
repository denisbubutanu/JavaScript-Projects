## As mentioned before, this is the better take on the Number to Roman Numeral Converter. 

Here I used an iterative approach on the converter while giving it a "legend" of sorts initially. I much prefer this approach to the original one; it taught me how to better use recursion and is much more readable and elegant compared to the original one. 


## Skills applied and design choices

Much like the "original" version, during this project I made use of string and array manipulation, DOM manipulation and event listeners. The difference lies in the fact that in this version, I made use of a recursive statement to handle the bulk of the logic. This gives rise to a simpler, cleaner and more elegant version of the project (the specifics of the method are better explained by the comments on the script.js file itself). 


## How to run?

Using GitHub Pages, the following link should allow you to see the code in action: https://denisbubutanu.github.io/JavaScript-Projects/numeral-roman-converter/improved/index.html

Note, this implementation should look exactly like the original version. It should also give the same answer as the original version.
