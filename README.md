## This is my JavaScript repository, home to projects meant to help me learn new concepts and consolidate existing ones. 

Each project will also have extremely basic HTML and CSS code to accompany the JavaScript code, but it is very bare-bones as I wanted the focus of these projects to be the JS code itself. The Numeral to Roman converter in particular I think is a nice project on iterating and improving code. I suggest you give it a look!

Each project will also have HTML and CSS code, although I wanted the focus of these projects to be more about the JavaScript code. Despite this, I learned quite a few new HTML and CSS concepts in the meantime such as defining CSS variables (particularly for colors) in the :root, as well as using other units such as vw, vh, rem, etc to immprove the responsiveness of my code.
