## This is my JavaScript repository, home to projects meant to help me learn new concepts and consolidate existing ones. 

Each project will also have HTML and CSS code, although I wanted the focus of these projects to be more about the JavaScript code. Despite this, I learned quite a few new HTML and CSS concepts in the meantime such as defining CSS variables (particularly for colors) in the :root, as well as using other units such as vw, vh, rem, etc to improve the responsiveness of my code. 

Each project README.md will have a link to the GitHub Pages of that project, so you can run it without having to clone or download repositories!
