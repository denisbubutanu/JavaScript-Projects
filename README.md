## This is my JavaScript repository, home to projects meant to help me learn new concepts and consolidate existing ones. 

Each project will also have extremely basic HTML and CSS code to accompany the JavaScript code, but it is very bare-bones as I wanted the focus of these projects to be the JS code itself. The Numeral to Roman converter in particular I think is a nice project on iterating and improving code. I suggest you give it a look!
