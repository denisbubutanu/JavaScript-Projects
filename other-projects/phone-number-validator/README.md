## This project dealt a lot with regexes.

There are many valid ways of writing phone numbers, in the US especially (with dashes, brackets, +, spaces, etc), so I made a US phone number validator. It also dealt a bit more with updating the HTML and CSS. 

## How to run?

Using GitHub Pages, the following link should allow you to see the code in action: https://denisbubutanu.github.io/JavaScript-Projects/other-projects/phone-number-validator/index.html
